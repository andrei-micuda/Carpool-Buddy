						<h2>The problem</h2>
						<p>Bucharest, faces a growing challenge that plagues its residents daily - urban congestion. The
							averagte citizen spends about 277 hours each year in traffic. With more cars on the road
							than ever before, getting from point A to point B can be a nightmare, not to mention the
							environmental impact of all those vehicles. Urban congestion in Bucharest is reaching
							critical levels. Rush hours are a nightmare, parking is scarce, and the time and money spent
							on daily commutes are skyrocketing. Bucharesters waste precious hours stuck in traffic,
							leading to increased stress and decreased quality of life.</p>
					</article>

					<article>
						<h2>Our solution</h2>
						<p>Introducing Carpool Buddy, the game-changer in Bucharest's transportation landscape. Our
							carpooling application is designed to tackle the city's traffic woes and make daily
							commuting easier. Here's how:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>Community-Driven Carpooling:</strong> Your app connects riders and drivers
									traveling short distances in Bucharest. Users can easily find others going the same
									way and share rides, effectively reducing the number of cars on the road.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>

								<p>
									<strong>Easy and Convenient:</strong> We've designed an intuitive and user-friendly
									app that makes it simple for commuters to find and book rides, ensuring a seamless
									experience for everyone.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>

								<p>
									<strong>Cost-Efficiency:</strong> Carpooling helps users save money on fuel,
									parking, and maintenance while contributing to a greener environment. The more you
									share, the more you save!
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>

								<p>
									<strong>Reduce Traffic and Emissions:</strong> By encouraging shared rides, we're
									actively working to reduce traffic congestion and decrease the carbon footprint in
									Bucharest. It's a win-win for both commuters and the environment.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</article>

						<h2>Competition & our competitive edge</h2>

						<p>In our competitive landscape, we face formidable rivals in the form of Bolt, Uber, and
							BlaBlaCar. While these competitors may hold an edge in marketing prowess, Carpool Buddy
							distinguishes itself with three key advantages:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Cost-efficiency and Environmental Responsibility:</strong> In contrast to the
								competition, our application offers a cost-effective and eco-friendly solution. This
								appeals to price-conscious consumers who also prioritize reducing their carbon
								footprint.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Focus on Shorter Routes and Traffic Mitigation:</strong> Our unique emphasis on
								shorter routes sets us apart, directly addressing the issue of traffic congestion. This
								strategic focus not only saves time for users but also contributes to more efficient
								urban transportation.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</article>

					<article>
						<h2>Key Metrics</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Rides Completed: The total number of rides completed is a fundamental metric, as it
								directly reflects the demand for the service.</li>
							<li>Average Revenue per User (ARPU): ARPU helps gauge the average spending per passenger.
								It's calculated by dividing the total revenue by the number of users.</li>
							<li>Customer Retention Rate: This metric shows how well the company is at keeping passengers
								over time. A high retention rate is often a sign of customer satisfaction.</li>
							<li>Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): CAC measures the cost of acquiring a new passenger. It
								includes marketing, advertising, and promotional expenses.</li>
							<li>Driver Acquisition Cost: Similar to CAC, driver acquisition cost measures how much it
								costs to recruit and onboard new drivers.</li>
							<li>Average Trip Distance: Knowing the average trip distance can help with pricing
								strategies, fuel efficiency, and driver earnings.</li>
							<li>Cancellation Rate: The percentage of trips that are canceled by either the passenger or
								driver. A high cancellation rate can indicate a problem in the system.</li>
							<li>Wait Time: The time passengers have to wait for a ride. Reducing wait times can improve
								customer satisfaction.</li>
							<li>Safety Incidents: Tracking incidents and safety complaints is crucial for maintaining a
								safe service and ensuring customer trust.</li>
							<li>Rating and Feedback: Monitoring passenger and driver ratings and feedback is essential
								for maintaining quality and improving service.</li>
							<li>Environmental Impact: Monitoring and reducing the carbon footprint of the business can
								be important for sustainability and public relations.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Validation 1</h2>
						<h3>How we identified the problem?</h3>
						<p>As university students and full-time employees, all team members in Bucharest deal with
							traffic issues to some extent. For instance, Andrei spends a minimum of 2 hours commuting
							between university and home via the metro.</p>
						<h3>What we thought was the solution?</h3>
						<p>We identified car pooling as a possible solution to this issue. The benefits of this solution
							are twofold:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Ease traffic congestion by reducing the number of 1-person cars.</li>
							<li>Provide a middleground solution between public transport and ride-hailing services.</li>
						</ol>
						<h3>Plan for customer discovery</h3>
						<p>We focused on 2 main commuter segments:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Corporate employees</li>
							<li>University students</li>
						</ul>
						<p>We selected these two segments as they belong to the category of people that spend a
							considerable amount of time with their commute. Another factor was the ease of reaching out
							to people belonging to these groups.</p>
						<h3>The customer validation process</h3>
						<p>We reached out to various acquaintances that we knew are living on the outskirts of Bucharest
							as well, as well as individuals who frequently traverse the urban expanse.</p>
						<p>The validation process consisted of a multi-way approach:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>face-to-face interviews</li>
							<li>online form</li>
							<li>one-on-one online communication</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Questions asked</h3>
						<p>
							All questions posed were derived from the online form (<a
								href="https://forms.gle/zXnDATR5bNkpZG417">link</a>). The proof to all the interviews
							can be found on <a
								href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GedOECAspaMLGPCH0-B0f6jd48-mYvbJ?usp=sharing">Google
								Drive</a>.
						</p>

						<h3>Findings</h3>
						<h4>Face-to-face interviews</h4>
						<h5>Case #1</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>Age Group: 25-49</li>
							<li>Works full-time <b>hybrid</b></li>
							<li>Discussion summary: He goes around town 2-3 times a week, mostly by metro. It takes him
								about one half an hour to reach the destinations. He considers that walking is better
								than sharing a crowed metro. He shared a car before and is willing to do it again.</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>Case #2</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>Age Group: 25-49</li>
							<li>Works full-time, <b>hybrid</b></li>
							<li>Discussion summary: She goes around town 5-7 times a week, mostly by car or Uber. It
								takes her 30 minutes to an hour to reach the destinations. When going to work, she
								drives to work. She would share a ride.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>One-on-one online communication</h4>
						<h5>Case #3</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>Age Group: 18-25</li>
							<li>Student, full-time employee, <b>only works from home</b></li>
							<li>Discussion summary: As he does not need to commute back and forth from work, he only
								commutes 5-6 times a week. Additionaly, he mostly uses public transport (metro, tram)
								and only used Uber/Bolt when in a rush or late at night.</li>
						</ul>
						<p></p>
						<h5>Case #4</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>Age Group: 18-25</li>
							<li>Works full-time, <b>on-site</b></li>
							<li>Discussion summary: He commutes 4 days by metro and 1 day by car. Outside of work
								commute, he mostly uses his car for other activities (especially if no metro station is
								near). He frequently car pools with friends (as the driver).</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>Case #5</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>Age Group: 18-25</li>
							<li>Works full-time, <b>hybrid</b></li>
							<li>Discussion summary: She goes around town 2-4 times a week, mostly by metro or Uber. It
								takes her about one hour to reach the destinations. She considers the traffic as being
								dangerous and chaotic. She shared a car before and is willing to do it again.</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>Case #6</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>Age Group: 18-25</li>
							<li>Works full-time, <b>on site</b>, goes to university on weekends</li>
							<li>Discussion summary: She goes around town 5-6 times a week, mostly by car or metro. It
								takes her 30 minutes to an hour to reach the destinations. When going to work, she is
								picked up by one of her co-workers. So she shares a car every working day.</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>Case #7</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>Age Group: 25-49</li>
							<li>Employed, works full-time, <b>from home and 2-5 days per month on site</b></li>
							<li>Discussion summary: We kicked off our discussion with an interesting point: she
								primarily works from home, with only 2-5 days a month requiring a 6-minute walk to the
								office. Curious about her previous employment, I inquired about the reasons for her job
								change. Although it wasn't her primary reason, she mentioned that the extended commute
								to her former workplace played a role. This insight shed light on her priorities, as she
								brought it up unprompted. I then asked about her use of Bolt, and she revealed that she
								turns to Bolt when she's in a hurry or when she wants to avoid switching subway lines.
								To conclude, I asked a more direct question: "Would you consider switching from Bolt to
								share a ride with someone going to a similar destination, even if it meant a 5-10 minute
								walk?" She expressed willingness to accept a 5-minute walk but drew the line at 10
								minutes.</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>Case #8</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>Age Group: 25-49</li>
							<li>Employed, works full-time, <b>3 days from home and 2 days on site</b></li>
							<li>Discussion summary: He commutes almost exclusively by metro. Only uses Uber/Bolt for
								emergencies or when in a rush. He says he would be open to car pooling if it means
								saving time during commutes and if the cost is not too high.</li>
						</ul>
